## Project 5 - Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (Neighborhood Map)
This project contains the source code of the implementation of the Fifth project assigment from Udacity's Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree: Neighborhood map.

The project consists of developing a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).


In this case, the web app allows to check if an artist or band is on tour. It is powered by [Last.fm's Developer API](http://www.last.fm/api).

The repository includes the following files:
* **app directory**: It contains the source code of the web app.
* **dist directory**: It contains the all files for the distribution of the app. It is generated automatically by the automation tool [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/).
* **test directory**: It contains the tests implemented for the app (Currently empty).
* **.bowerrc**: Config file used by the package manager [Bower](http://bower.io/).
* **.gitattributes**: Config file used by [Git](http://www.git-scm.com).
* **.gitignore**: Config file used by [Git](http://www.git-scm.com). It contains the excluded files and directories ignored by Git.
* **.yo-rc.json**: Config file to saved the configuration used by [Yeoman](http://www.yeoman.io).
* **README.md**: The GitHub readme file.
* **.bower.json**: Manifest file used by Bower. It contains all Bower package dependencies used by the project.
* **gulpfile.bable.js**: Automation script used by GulpJS. It contains tasks such as _clean_, _build_ or _deploy_.
* **package.json**: Manifest file used by [NPM](http://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.
